# World-Layoffs-Capstone-Project
IThis project aimed to look at the layoffs around the world and to gain insight on what countries, industries and companies had the most layoffs from March 2020 to March 2023. I used MySQL for data cleaning along with querying my data. I used Tableau for my visualizations.
